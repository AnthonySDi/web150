What does the code do? Why is it interesting or unusual?
It allows you to play hangman the game. It's fun and I find it interesting because it will draw the man being hanged. Poor guy. 


How recently was the code updated?


Created JULY 30, 2014 // Updated JANUARY 27, 2015
What dependencies does the code have? (e.g. does it require JQuery? Does it require an api key?)


It’s vanilla JS. To my knowledge no outer libraries are required for it. Not that I can find in the Pen.






Where is the public code location (e.g. on Github.com)?
