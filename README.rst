Class Summary
++++
JavaScript is the primary programming language for web development. This class covers the fundamental features of JavaScript and how to effectively use JavaScript in the browser. Weâ€™ll write our own scripts, ranging from simple menus to complex graphics and animations. We'll also learn how to retrieve results from a server without a full-page refresh (AJAX), and use templating systems to place that information into the web page. Throughout the course we will use common tools and techniques of professional web developers, such as source control, browser debuggers, and dependency management. All assignments will be turned in and evaluated using GitHub.


Required Materials
++++
There is no printed textbook for this course. We will use <a href="https://thomaswilburn.github.io/textbook/">JavaScript for the Web Savvy</a>, which was written specifically for this program, as our primary text. Additional readings will be made available on the resources page, or posted to the class's GitHub repo. Students should also acquire the following free resources:

A GitHub account. Note that with a student e-mail address, you can sign up for an educational account, which includes free private repositories and other benefits.
The Git client software, installed on the computer where you'll do your homework.
A modern, syntax-highlighting code editor. such as Brackets, Komodo Edit, Atom, or Sublime Text.
 

Note - Students can use a free online service such as Cloud9 (https://c9.io/) to access development tools from any computer.

Class Structure and Topics
++++
Each week, we'll cover a different topic, building on the previous week's work. In general, we will cover new material in Tuesday lectures, and Thursdays will be more about putting what we've learned into practice. We will cover the following topics, although the order and precise list is subject to revision:

- Variables, values, and types
- Conditional statements
- Loops and arrays
- Objects and object iteration
- Functions
- Forms & data validation
- DOM manipulation with JQuery
- jQuery events & effects
- AJAX and JSON
- Drawing

Every Thursday, you'll be given an assignment to test what you've picked up on that week's topic. Assignments are due by the start of class on the following Tuesday. The purpose of these assignments is to evaluate your progress and understanding, and to provide me with an opportunity to offer feedback. As such, most of your grade each week will come from turning the assignment in on time and showing that you tried to solve it using your own original work. Your homework should be completely your own: plagiarism will not be tolerated, at all.

80% of your grade will come from homework, 10% from class participation, and 10% will come from a "book report" that you'll present at the end of the quarter on a piece of open-source JavaScript that you find interesting. The presentation should include a copy of the source code, annotated with your comments.
